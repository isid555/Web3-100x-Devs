# Staking
Staking is a way to participate in the security and operation of a blockchain network while earning rewards. It involves locking up your cryptocurrency in a wallet or staking platform to support the network, validate transactions, and secure the blockchain.

## Liquid Staking
Liquid staking solves the lockup problem by issuing you a liquid staking token (e.g., stETH or mSOL), allowing you to use your staked funds in DeFi while still earning staking rewards.



## Key Takeaways:
Validators don’t need to own SOL; they act as trusted operators for staking.
The staked SOL comes from delegators who trust validators to secure the network.
Earning Model: Validators earn commissions on staking rewards, not from owning the staked tokens.
Real-Life Analogy: Think of validators as fund managers—they manage staked SOL on behalf of delegators while taking a small fee for their service.

### Summary
In today's lecture, we explored Liquid Staking Tokens (LSTs) in-depth, understanding their functionality, benefits, and implementation. LSTs allow users to stake their assets while maintaining liquidity, enabling participation in DeFi without locking up their funds. Harkirat explained how LSTs reflect staking rewards and provided real-life analogies to simplify the concept
