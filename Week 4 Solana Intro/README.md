The Key Difference:
Coins are like the main money of the digital world, and you use them to pay for things on their blockchain.
Tokens are special items that can do different things, like act as tickets, give you voting power, or represent cool stuff (like a game item or collectible).

Simple Example:
Coin: Like having real money (like dollars or coins) that you can use anywhere.
Token: Like having a special game token that lets you buy things in your favorite game, but itâ€™s not money you can use anywhere else.
In short, coins are the main money of a blockchain, and tokens are like special items or points that can do cool things on the blockchain!
